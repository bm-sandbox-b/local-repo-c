// Splitting on commas is the version everybody writes first and it is wrong on
// the second file it meets: a field can be quoted, a quoted field can contain
// a comma, a newline, or a quote of its own written as two quotes. So this is
// a character scanner rather than a `split`, which is more code and the only
// way to be right about the cases that actually turn up.
//
// RFC 4180 with the concessions reality demands: CRLF or LF, and a last line
// with or without a terminator.

// A single quote inside a quoted field is written as two. That is the whole
// escaping rule -- there is no backslash in CSV, and treating one as an escape
// silently mangles Windows paths.
